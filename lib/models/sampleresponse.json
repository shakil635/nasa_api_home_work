NIMS studies infrared wavelengths of light that our eye cannot see. These maps are at four different infrared wavelengths, each one picked to reveal something different about the atmosphere.  The top image is a false color map of a wavelength that is at the red edge of our ability to see. It shows the shapes of features that we would see with our eyes.  The second map is of ammonia ice, red showing where the most ice is, blue where none exists. The differences between this and the first image are due to the amount and size of ammonia ice crystals.  The third map down is from a wavelength that shows cloud heights, with the highest clouds in red, and the lowest in blue.  The bottom map uses a wavelength that shows the hot Jupiter shining through the clouds. Red represents the thinnest clouds, and blue is thickest where it is more difficult to see below. Comparing the bottom two images, note that the highest clouds are in the center of the Great Red Spot, while there are relatively few clouds around the edges.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00501"

Each of the three frames is a mosaic of six images that have been map-projected to a uniform grid of latitude and longitude. North is at the top. There is a nine-hour separation between the first two frames and seventy minutes between the next two. All of the images were taken on June 26, 1996. The Red Spot is 20,000 km long and has been followed by observers on Earth since the telescope was invented 300 years ago. It is a huge storm made visible by variations in the composition of the cloud particles and the amount of cloud cover. Winds in the outer part of the Red Spot reach 250 mph while the center remains quiescent. These Galileo data will help scientists understand what drives this storm and why it persists for so many years.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01083"

You can also see a series of storms shaped like white ovals, known informally as the \"string of pearls.\" Below the Great Red Spot a reddish long-lived storm known as Oval BA is visible.  The image was taken on Dec. 11, 2016 at 2:30 p.m. PST (5:30 p.m. EST), as the Juno spacecraft performed its third close flyby of Jupiter. At the time the image was taken, the spacecraft was about 285,100 miles (458,800 kilometers) from the planet.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21376  .  -    Enhanced image by Roman Tkachenko (CC-BY) based on images provided courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS"

Because of this, many expected to see the wind speeds inside the Great Red Spot increasing as the storm was shrinking. But surprisingly, this isn't the case: the wind speeds aren't changing. Instead, the storm is actually growing taller. The Great Red Spot is deepening in color as well. A team from NASA, New Mexico State University and the University of California at Berkeley made these discoveries by pouring over data from numerous NASA missions, including Voyager, Hubble and Juno.",

                        "description": "This image of Jupiter's iconic Great Red Spot (GRS) was created by citizen scientist BjÃ¶rn JÃ³nsson using data from the JunoCam imager on NASA's Juno spacecraft.  This true-color image offers a natural color rendition of what the Great Red Spot and surrounding areas would look like to human eyes from Juno's position. The tumultuous atmospheric zones in and around the Great Red Spot are clearly visible.  The image was taken on July 10, 2017 at 07:10 p.m. PDT (10:10 p.m. EDT), as the Juno spacecraft performed its seventh close flyby of Jupiter. At the time the image was taken, the spacecraft was about 8,648 miles (13,917 kilometers) from the tops of the clouds of the planet at a latitude of -32.6 degrees. https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21775.  -   Enhanced image by BjÃ¶rn JÃ³nsson (CC-NC-SA) based on images provided courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS"

The perspective begins about 2,000 miles (3,000 kilometers) above the cloud tops of the planet's southern hemisphere. The bar at far left indicates altitude during the quick descent; a second gauge next to that depicts the dramatic increase in temperature that occurs as the perspective dives deeper down. The clouds turn crimson as the perspective passes through the Great Red Spot. Finally, the view ascends out of the spot.

                        "description": "This image of Jupiter's iconic Great Red Spot and surrounding turbulent zones was captured by NASA's Juno spacecraft. The color-enhanced image is a combination of three separate images taken on April 1 between 3:09 a.m. PDT (6:09 a.m. EDT) and 3:24 a.m. PDT (6:24 a.m. EDT), as Juno performed its 12th close flyby of Jupiter. At the time the images were taken, the spacecraft was 15,379 miles (24,749 kilometers) to 30,633 miles (49,299 kilometers) from the tops of the clouds of the planet at a southern latitude spanning 43.2 to 62.1 degrees. Citizen scientists Gerald EichstÃ¤dt and SeÃ¡n Doran processed this image using data from the JunoCam imager. https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21985"

Their backups, Alexey Ovchinin of Roscosmos and Nick Hague of NASA, also participated in the visits. Artemyev, Feustel and Arnold are scheduled to launch on March 21 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in the Soyuz MS-08 spacecraft for a five-month mission on the orbiting laboratory."

The selected wavelength is sensitive to Jupiter's tropospheric temperatures and the thickness of a cloud near the condensation level of ammonia gas. The Great Red Spot appears distinctively at the lower center of the planet as a cold region with a thick cloud layer. It is surrounded by a warm and relatively clear periphery. To its northwest is a turbulent and chaotic region where bands of gas that is warm and dry alternate with bands of gas that is cold and moist.  This image, taken a few hours before Juno's sixth close approach to Jupiter, shows the detailed atmospheric structure of the Great Red Spot and its surroundings that the Juno mission will encounter on its seventh closest approach to Jupiter on July 10, 2017, Pacific Time (July 11, Universal Time).  The instrument used to take this image is Cooled Mid-Infrared Camera and Spectrometer (COMICS) of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan's Subaru Telescope on Hawaii's Maunakea peak.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21714"

From top to bottom, the moons shown are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.  The Great Red Spot, a storm in Jupiter's atmosphere, is at least 300 years old. Winds blow counterclockwise around the Great Red Spot at about 400 kilometers per hour (250 miles per hour). The storm is larger than one Earth diameter from north to south, and more than two Earth diameters from east to west. In this oblique view, the Great Red Spot appears longer in the north-south direction.  Europa, the smallest of the four moons, is about the size of Earth's moon, while Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system. North is at the top of this composite picture in which the massive planet and its largest satellites have all been scaled to a common factor of 15 kilometers (9 miles) per picture element.  The Solid State Imaging (CCD) system aboard NASA's Galileo spacecraft obtained the Jupiter, Io and Ganymede images in June 1996, while the Europa images were obtained in September 1996. Because Galileo focuses on high resolution imaging of regional areas on Callisto rather than global coverage, the portrait of Callisto is from the 1979 flyby of NASA's Voyager spacecraft.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00600"

                        "description": "Citizen scientist David Englund created this avant-garde Jovian artwork using data from the JunoCam imager on NASA's Juno spacecraft.  The unique interpretation of Jupiter's Great Red Spot was done in a style that pays tribute to French Impressionist painter Claude Monet.  The original image was taken on July 10, 2017 at 7:12 p.m. PDT (10:12 p.m. EDT), as the Juno spacecraft performed its 7th close flyby of Jupiter. At the time the image was taken, the spacecraft was 10,274 miles (16,535 kilometers) from the tops of the clouds of the planet, at a latitude of -36.9 degrees. https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21779 . -   Enhanced image by David Englund based on images provided courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS"

The changes in the signal frequency represent the changes in the local gravity as the spacecraft flew low overhead.  Juno flew twice over the Great Red Spot in 2019, with the goal of picking up the subtle gravitational signal of the vortex. The concentration of mass caused by the powerful winds surrounding the Great Red Spot minutely change the spacecraft's velocity, inducing a Doppler shift on the radio signals relayed back to Earth.
